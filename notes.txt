TDD = Test Driven Design
write your tests before writing your code

why TDD? 
3 major benefits 
gives devs safety net to change code, knowing things wont break
Documents your code for how it is supposed to work
gives you guidanc on how to build your code

building tests - test all "interesting" cases
anything that takes you down a different path of the code
do not build extra tests if you don't need it

don't write your test in your test file
